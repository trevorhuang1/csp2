### Plans for Week 3:
1. Follow along in class and clone the student repository again.
2. Get the snake game working and fix the colors
3. Learn basic python and get used to working with jupyter notebooks
4. Create a calculator that works
5. Make some other mini-projects
6. Make the website look more attractive


## Week 2 Summary:
This is when I started major progress on the snake game, calculator, and the quiz. I mainly focused on the snake game and my partner Kyle did a lot of work on the quiz. A really irritating issue was that whenever I started the snake game, the screen would move up and down when I used the arrow keys. I fixed the problem with a couple lines of code I found online. Additionally, I changed the colors of the snake game to make it look better. I didn't know how to get the calculator working until a friend helped link the style.css file to the calculator.md file. Kyle and I decided to make our quiz on guessing movie titles based on a combination of emojis.


## Week 1 Summary:
Turns out I wasn't commiting correctly. I had to make my own repository which I named csp. During the week I fixed up the website to make it look more presentable for the first pair showcase. Surprisingly, I encountered no errors that couldn't be fixed instantly.

## Week 0 Summary:
I set up the website and began to alter it. Throughout the setup process, I encountered issues with WSL, as I was stuck as "root". This was solved by uninstalling then reinstalling WSL. I also ran into an error: "Wsl/Service/CreateInstance/MountVhd/ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND". However, with the help of ChatGPT, "wsl --unregister Ubuntu" and "wsl --install -d Ubuntu" solved the issue. The rest of my time was spent practicing committing and pushing to github as well as adding my freeform photo to my home page.

## Week 1 Summary:
Turns out I wasn't commiting correctly. I had to make my own repository which I named csp. During the week I fixed up the website to make it look more presentable for the first pair showcase. Surprisingly, I encountered no errors that couldn't be fixed instantly.

<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="csp2"
        issue-term="pathname"
        theme="github-light"
